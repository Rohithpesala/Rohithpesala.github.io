summary: The aim of this project is to create an app that would take video of an object or a scene as input and produce a corresponding 3D model. There are many approaches to scene reconstruction but the challenge here was to develop such algorithm, which would be lightweight and very time efficient. We observe that contrary to other approaches, we have continuous video feed and hence capitalize on this fact to construct our implementation.
