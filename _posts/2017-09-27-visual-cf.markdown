title:  "Visually Explainable Recommendations using Attentive-CF"
date:   2017-09-27
categories: Research
head: UMass Amherst, Rutgers University (Jun 2017, Oct 2017 - present)
summary: Previous work in this area includes images and deep networks to improve the recommender systems. We argue that at the client level, this information can be used better by providing explanation to the user about why the recommendation was provided. This is mainly done by providing abstract level images and human annotated explanations of these abstractions.
