I am a Computer Science Graduate Student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. As a Machine Learning enthusiast, my work covers multiple sub-areas including Computer Vision, NLP, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement learning. With this knowledge, I like to solve real world problems and develop innovative products.

I have previously worked as a Graduate Research Intern at IESL, UMass Amherst for the summer of 2017. I worked on developing a dependency parser for PubMed articles with <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/">Andrew McCallum</a> and <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~luke/">Luke Vilnis</a>. Presently, I grade the course [CS 689: Machine Learning](http://openscholar.cs.umass.edu/marlin/classes/compsci-689-machine-learning) taught by [Ben Marlin](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~marlin/index.shtml)

In my leisure time, I play sports, travel, hike, go on adventures and watch anime.
