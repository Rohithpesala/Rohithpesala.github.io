I am a Computer Science Gradute Student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am a Machine Learning enthusiast. My work covers multiple sub-areas including Computer Vision, NLP, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement learning. I especially strive to solve real world problems using this knowledge.

I have previously worked as a Graduate Research Intern at IESL, UMass Amherst for the summer of 2017. I worked on developing a dependency parser for PubMed articles with <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/">Andrew McCallum</a> and <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~luke/">Luke Vilnis</a>.

Apart from academics, I play sports including badminton, tennis, table tennis and cricket. I love to travel, hike and go on adventures. I am also an ardent fan of anime (Recommendations welcome).
