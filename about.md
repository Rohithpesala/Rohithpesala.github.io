# __Interesting stuff__

* __Work with kids__: Working with kids interests me the most. So, during my undergrad I volunteered for couple of things which involved working with kids.
  * __Takshila__: It was one of the best experiences of my life to teach the kids play chess at this school. It was amazing towards the end when we were able to get the kids to participate in the State level tournament and see them performing well.
  * __Bridge school__: This school was started by one of my Professor's wife, Sandhya Menon and Prof Bhavender Paul. I was lucky to be involved with them from the start. The school's main objective was to provide basic schooling for the laborers' kids working at IIT Mandi. So, we used to teach the kids for about an hour or two every evening. Teaching these kids was especially tough because they haven't been to any school before but after about 6 months, we saw the progress and then we were able to get them into the government schools nearby.
* __Sports__: Playing sports is one of my biggest hobbies. 
  * __Badminton__: I started playing badminton in undergrad for fun and now I am also part of the UMass Badminton Club where I get to play insane players, which makes it even more fun
  * __Lawn Tennis__: I am proud to say that I was a part of the Tennis squad representing IIT Mandi during my Freshman year.
  * I also play cricket, table tennis, racquetball, chess, soccer and many others.
* __Travel__: Another one of my major interests in life is to travel and explore as much as possible. It's not just the areas that I want to visit. I'd love to visit countries, stay there for sometime and get to know the culture, learn a bit of their language and move on to the next. I am also a big nature lover. That is why I love to go on hikes and go for long drives. Similarly, I also like to do a lot of adventure activities and love having adrenaline rush.
