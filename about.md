# __Interesting stuff__

* __Work with kids__: I love kids the most. So, even during my undergrad I volunteered for couple of things which got me working with kids in turn increasing my interest to do it more often.
  * __Takshila__: I volunteered at Takshila Primary School to teach the kids play chess. It was one of the best experiences of my life as I was having fun but also teaching which helped the kids. It was amazing towards the end when I was able to take the kids to the State level tournament and see them performing well (the kids that knew nothing about chess before I started). Please see my [blog](/blog/) for more stories. (2015-2016)
  * __Bridge school__: This school was started by one of my Professor's wife, Sandhya Menon and Prof Bhavender Paul. I was lucky to be involved with them from the start. The school's main objective was to provide basic schooling for the laborers' kids working at IIT Mandi. So, we used to teach the kids for about an hour or two every evening. Teaching these kids was especially tough because they haven't been to any school before but after about 6 months, we saw the progress and that feeling of happiness is immeasurable. Again, look at my [blog](/blog/) for more information. (2016)
* __Sports__: If I am not attending classes or distracted by cute kids, I am probably playing some sport. I love to explore differnt sports but might not be great at them :P. 
  * __Badminton__: I started playing badminton in undergrad for fun and now I am also part of the UMass Badminton Club where I get to play insane players, which makes it even more fun
  * __Lawn Tennis__: I am proud to say that I was a part of the Tennis squad representing IIT Mandi during my Freshman year.
  * I also play cricket, table tennis, racquetball, chess, soccer and many others.
* __Travel__: I guess the reason that I love to travel so much is because I have never stayed put in a place for more than 2 years. I love exploring new places and one of my many aims in life is to explore the world as much as possible. I can't express my love for travel in such short paragraphs. If you want to know more, look at my [blog](/blog/).
